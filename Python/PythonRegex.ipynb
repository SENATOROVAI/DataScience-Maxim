This is useful when we know precisely what we're looking for, right down to the actual letters and whether or not they're upper or lower case. If we don't know the exact format of the strings we want, we'd be lost. Fortunately, regex has basic patterns that account for this scenario. Let's look at the ones we use in this tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "- w matches alphanumeric characters, which means a-z, A-Z, and 0-9. It also matches the underscore, _, and the dash, -.\n",

    "- s matches whitespace characters, which include the tab, new line, carriage return, and space characters.\n",

    "- . matches any character except the new line character n.\n",
