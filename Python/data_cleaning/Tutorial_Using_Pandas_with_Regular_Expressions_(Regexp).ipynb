    "## 1. What is Regular Expression (Regex)?\n",
    "A regular expression, often abbreviated as regex, is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. It is used to match and manipulate strings based on patterns, allowing you to find, replace, or extract specific parts of text. Regex is a powerful tool used in various programming languages and tools for text processing tasks.\n",

    "In this tutorial, we’ve explored how to use Pandas with regular expressions (regex) for text data manipulation tasks. We started by introducing the concept of regex and its importance in text processing. We then demonstrated how to get started with Pandas and regex, and provided two examples to showcase its practical application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions offer a powerful way to manipulate and extract information from text data. When combined with Pandas, they become a valuable tool for data preprocessing, cleaning, and analysis. As you continue working with real-world datasets, you’ll likely encounter scenarios where regex can significantly simplify complex text manipulation tasks. By mastering the integration of Pandas with regex, you’ll be better equipped to handle various text-related challenges in your data analysis projects."
